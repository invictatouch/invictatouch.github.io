Invicta Touch is an independent touch rugby club based in Canterbury in Kent. We are affiliated
to [England Touch](https://englandtouch.org.uk) and play under
[Federation of International Touch](https://internationaltouch.org) rules.

We provide opportunities for anybody who wants to play touch socially or competitively,
regardless of age, gender, fitness or ability.
We compete against the top clubs in the country in the National Touch Series and
more than 30 of our current and former players have gone on to represent England, at
all levels from under-15s to over-50s.
Our annual [summer league]({{<ref "/league" >}}) is one of the biggest club leagues in England,
with over 150 players playing each week for 10 weeks every summer.
