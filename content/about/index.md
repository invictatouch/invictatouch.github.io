Invicta Touch is an independent touch rugby club based in Canterbury in Kent. We are affiliated
to [England Touch](https://englandtouch.org.uk) and play under
[Federation of International Touch](https://internationaltouch.org) rules.
We provide opportunities for anybody who wants to play touch socially or competitively,
regardless of age, gender, fitness or ability.

#### Social Touch
Each week throughout the year we typically have two adult touch sessions and one junior session
(during school term time only) with coaching and game time. All sessions are mixed gender and open
to all. Check our [calendar]({{<relref "/calendar" >}}) for the latest times and venues.
Fully inclusive and pay-to-play [membership]({{<relref "/join" >}}) options are available and
new players are welcome to try two sessions for free before signing up.

Our annual [summer league]({{<relref "/league" >}}), open to members and non-members alike, is one of
the biggest club leagues in England with 16 teams and around 180 players playing each week for 10
weeks every summer.

#### Competitive Touch
Our elite mixed and single-gender teams compete against the top clubs in the country in the top
division of the National Touch Series and our development side plays in the South East Development
Series and other events. Our players are frequently selected to represent the South East Sharks and
South East Taipans in the Touch Nationals each year and many of our current and former players have
gone on to play for England, at all levels from under-15s to over-55s.
