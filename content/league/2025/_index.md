#### Competition Format
* The initial phase of the competition involves all 16 teams in a Monrad-style qualification stage.
  * In this phase each team will play 4 matches against different teams.
  * Pairings for the first round of matches will be determined by seedings with teams playing against opposition with a similar seeding.
  * In the second week winners will play winners and losers will play losers.
  * Likewise in subsequent rounds teams will be paired against other teams with the same number of wins as them.
  * After 4 weeks this will result in a ranking of all teams from 1 to 16.
* For the second phase of the competition, teams will be divided into 4 divisions - the Cup, Plate, Bowl and Shield.
  * The top 4 teams from the first team will enter the Cup, the next 4 the Plate and so on.
  * Teams will play each of the other teams in their division over the next 3 weeks.
  * Teams will earn 4 points for a win, 2 for a draw, 1 for a defeat, and none for a forfeit.
* In week 8 each division will contest its semi-finals (1st vs. 4th & 2nd vs. 3rd).
* The semi-final winners will contest finals in week 9 while the losers play-off for their final positions.
