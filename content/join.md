Invicta Touch offers a range of different membership options, providing
opportunities for all individuals to engage in Touch.
**Your first two sessions with us are free** &mdash; afterwards membership can be
paid via Direct Debit. Your membership covers you for the full year, using
grass and 3G/4G pitches, as well as having access to indoor training and
fitness sessions during the winter months. See below for a full
breakdown of the year's training sessions.

Members will receive coaching from England Touch players
who will help develop your skills in a welcoming and social environment.
We offer a range of different player pathways &mdash; including junior,
development, elite, and senior levels &mdash; with a focus on providing
opportunities for all members to progress and compete at their desired
level.
