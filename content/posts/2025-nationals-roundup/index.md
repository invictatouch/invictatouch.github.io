of Nottingham over the weekend, winning titles in the women's open, mixed open, and men's 40s divisions.

Lydia Ticehurst was part of the South East Sharks team that ended the South East Taipans' run
of five consecutive women's opens titles with a dramatic drop-off finish in the final. Lydia had
also been part of the last victorious Sharks team in 2018.

Invicta team-mates Eliot Nye (South East Sharks) and Toby Lister (South West
Saxons) faced off against each other in the mixed open final. The Saxons, with another Invicta man
&mdash; Charlie Meredith &mdash; as assistant coach, claimed the title with a 10-6 win.

In the men's 40s, the South East Taipans completed the weekend unbeaten despite a strong challenge
from the Saxons. Debutant Mike Bailey became a Nationals winner at the first attempt, alongside
Invicta club-mate Dan Dyer who won his fifth Nationals title overall and third in the 40s division.

Elsewhere there were third-place finishes for Vaughn Meredith (South East Taipans men's open),
Tor Summers and Euan Strachan (South East Taipans mixed open), Alice Summers and Millie Bunn (Midland
Tigers women's open), and Eddie French and Martin Reynard (South East Sharks men's 50s).
