Wombles had topped the standings at the end of the round-robin stage with their only defeat coming
against second-placed Not Trying Enough. They gained their revenge in the final though, running out
comfortable 7-1 winners. Ruck Me Till I Scrum took third place with victory over Human Touch in
their play-off, while Touching Turkeys won the plate competition.

The REDS went into their final as the only unbeaten team in either division, having won eight from
eight, including a narrow victory over Boys Become Men in week 4, but the tables were turned as
the team in green won 9-5 to claim the trophy. Exiles finished third and Touched 4 the Very Third
Time won the plate.
