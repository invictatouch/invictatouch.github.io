Invicta's elite mixed team finished 12th out of 16 teams on their Division One debut at the
National Touch Series in Burton-on-Trent on Saturday.
<!--more-->
Having earned promotion two weeks ago, Invicta were competitive against the top mixed teams in
the country. An early win over Manchester Foxes got the day off to a good start but defeat by
a single try against London Scorpions and loss to Bristol Jets meant we would be in the bottom
half for the afternoon's knock-out games.

A comfortable bowl quarter-final victory over Oxford was followed by a nail-biting semi-final
against Chester Cheetahs that the northern team edged 3-2.
A third single-try loss of the day in the play-off against Revolution meant we finished 12th overall,
achieving the primary aim for the day of retaining top division status for the final round in August.


*Team: Holly Atkinson, Cassandra Firman, Matt Mayall, Charlie Meredith, Stuart Meredith,
Vaughn Meredith, Ashleigh Newbold, Lola Sanderson, Kit Sorgo, Christian Scott, Lydia Ticehurst
