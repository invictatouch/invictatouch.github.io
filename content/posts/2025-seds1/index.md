Invicta's mixed development side won the Plate at Round 1 of the 12-team South East Development
Series in Horsham on Saturday, finishing 5th overall.

A full 14-strong playing contingent ranging in age from 15 to 59 made the trip to Sussex along with
a trio of enthusiastic supporters.

The day got off to a good start with a comfortable 4-1 win over London Scorpions Gurus in the first
game of the pool stage.

However the second match, against Surrey Bisons, was a step up in intensity and Invicta were
quickly 2-0 down until a quick-fire double in the final minute of the first half levelled the scores
before Bisons scored the only try of the second half to claim the win.

The final pool game against Southampton Stormers was another close contest. The Hampshire side
won 2-1, which meant both teams would be in the second-tier Plate semi-finals for the knock-out
phase.

In a semi-final rematch against Bisons, Invicta this time exerted a degree of control from the
outset and closed out a 4-2 win to set-up another rematch in the final against Southampton, which
saw the team's best performance of the day and a 4-1 win to claim the Plate.
