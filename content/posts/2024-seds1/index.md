This year's South East Development Series began in Horsham on Saturday with Invicta's
mixed development team contesting six hard-fought matches against other clubs from the region.
<!--more-->
Nine Invicta players of varying ages and experience were joined by five of our friends
from Tunbridge Wells Titans as the combined talents of Kent faced off against teams from Sussex,
Surrey, and London. All of the matches were competitive and after three wins and three defeats
we finished in the middle of the pack, fourth of the seven teams, with lots of positives as well as
areas to improve ahead of round two in November.

The day finished on a high note with individual recognition for two of our players as Katie Toombs
and Mike Bailey were named the female and male MVPs (Most Valuable Players) for the tournament.

Thanks to Horsham Tigers for organising and hosting this event once again. We look forward to
competing in the remaining rounds over the winter.

*Team: Mike Bailey, Dale Bright, Chris Church, Erin Collins, Dan Dyer, Fran Gan, Christian Garland,
Simon Goodden, Katy Larkins, Vaughn Meredith, Martin Reynard, Katie Toombs, Elvis, Guthrie*
