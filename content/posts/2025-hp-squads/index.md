Following strong showings in the uncapped European [Opens]({{<relref "/posts/2025-european-opens-results" >}})
and [Seniors]({{<relref "/posts/2025-european-seniors-results" >}}) cups this summer, nine Invicta
players have been included for the beginning of England's 2026 Euros campaign.

In the opens divisions, Alice Summers and Lydia Ticehurst are in the women's training squad with Gus
Lister and Vaughn Meredith in the men's squad.

We're also well represented in the masters divisions with Suz Wilson in the women's over-40s, Dan
Dyer in the men's 45s, Adrian Riggs in the men's 50s, and Spencer Nye and Martin Reynard in the
men's 55s. In addition, Invicta's Eddie French is assistant coach for the men's 50s.

All of England's adult squads met in Cheltenham at the weekend for a two-day induction and training
camp. There will be further camps each month through the winter before the current expanded squads
are reduced to the final touring squads of 16 plus reserves at the beginning of May.
