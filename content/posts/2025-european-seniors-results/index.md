Six Invicta Touch players represented England at the European Senior Touch Cup in Stirling over the
weekend and all six came home with a medal after a strong showing from the English teams.

Suz Wilson won silver in the
[women’s 40s/45s division](https://internationaltouch.org/events/other-events/european-seniors-cup-2025/womens-40/)
as the English 40s defeated their over-45s compatriots 7-3 in an all-England final.

Dan Dyer was the top try scorer in the
[men’s 45s/50s/55s division](https://internationaltouch.org/events/other-events/european-seniors-cup-2025/mens-masters-455055/)
as England's 45s capped a dominant three days with a 12-2 victory over Ireland to take gold in the 45s
final.

Captain Adrian Riggs led the England men’s 50s to a narrow 5-4 victory in the
[Simon Yarrow Cup](https://www.englandtouch.org.uk/england-m35s-to-challenge-for-yarrow-memorial-cup/)
against Scotland. The two sides met again in the men’s 50s/55s final the following day with the home
team getting their revenge in another close game, winning 7-6 in a drop-off to leave England with
the silver medals.

Perhaps the most impressive performance over the three days came from the England men’s 55s team
&mdash; featuring Invicta’s Eddie French, Spencer Nye and Martin Reynard &mdash; who, despite
competing exclusively against younger teams and losing two players to injury, came away with the
bronze medals following an 8-5 victory over Portugal’s men’s 50s team in the third-place play-off.
