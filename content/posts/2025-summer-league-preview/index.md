The Invicta Touch summer league gets underway at the Langton Grammar School for Boys in Canterbury
on Wednesday 14th May and with 18 teams set to take part this year it will be Kent's biggest ever
touch league.

The addition of two more teams brings a change to the format and an extra round of matches.
This year we will have three divisions with six teams in each. The initial division allocations
have been made based on previous league performance and the apparent strength of each squad.

In the first phase of the league each team will play each of the others in their division over five
weeks. After this there will be promotion and relegation with the bottom two teams in each division
replaced by the top two teams from the division below. This enables teams to find their ideal level
ahead of the second round-robin phase in which each team will play each of the other teams in their
updated division. Final standings will be determined by points accrued in the second phase.

All teams are invited to join a practice session on Wednesday 7th May where our coaches and referees
will help teams get up to speed before the first round of matches on 14th May.
