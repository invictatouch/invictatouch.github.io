Invicta Touch's women's team completed a successful first campaign in the Men's & Women's
National Touch Series by winning Division Two and earning promotion to Division One for the 2026 season.

After initially intending to compete in Division Three in their debut season, the team were given a
last-minute entry to Division Two ahead of the first round in Burton-on-Trent a few weeks ago.
Undeterred by the step up in competition, the ladies were victorious on finals day in Leamington Spa
at the weekend, earning a place in the Division Two final where they claimed a 7-3 victory against
Thames Valley Vikings. As a result, the team will compete in Division One next season as one of the
top eight ranked sides in England.

In the men's competition Invicta finished seventh in Division One. With only the top 6 sides
retaining their top division status this meant that the team narrowly failed to avoid relegation and
will compete in Division Two next year.

Attention now turns to the Mixed National Touch Series which gets underway in Leamington Spa next
weekend, with Invicta's elite team in Division One and our development side in Division Three.
