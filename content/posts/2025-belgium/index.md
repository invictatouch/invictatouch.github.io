The trip to Belgium with Invicta Touch was an unforgettable experience from start to finish.
Across four competitive games, the squad showed real cohesion, energy, and flair, growing stronger
with every match. The final against a strong Belgian side was the toughest test of the day, but the
team rose to the occasion with confidence and composure.

Ellen was electric on the wing, scoring some superb long-range tries after slick, pinpoint passes
that opened up the space for her to fly down the line. The Lister brothers were in classic form,
setting up tries for each other with the kind of instinctive link play only siblings seem to have.
Meg and Lloyd, the newest additions to Invicta, slotted in seamlessly and made a brilliant impact
throughout the day, showing real potential and determination.

From great performances to great company, the whole squad enjoyed a fantastic day out &mdash; and
topping it off with winning the tournament made the trip even more special. A huge thank you to all
the supporters who came to watch us, and to the Belgians for hosting us so warmly (and to Angus for
hosting some of our supporters!).
