13 of Invicta's junior players took part in the South East Schools Championships in Reigate on
Friday, supported by our junior lead Tom Humphreys.
The Langton year 7/8 boys' team won their age category and junior coach Lola Sanderson was
also victorious with her team.

These players have been honing their skills at the Invicta Touch junior sessions, which we run
every Friday during term times from 4pm until 5pm at The Langton School for Boys in Canterbury.
