Invicta's Gus Lister and Vaughn Meredith won men's open gold medals with England Mavericks at the
[European Opens Cup](https://internationaltouch.org/events/other-events/european-opens-cup-2025/)
in Italy last weekend while Lydia Ticehurst and Millie Bunn claimed bronze in the women's open.

England reinforced its status as the leading touch nation in Europe by entering three teams in both
the men's and the women's events in Calvisano and coming away with five of the six medals on offer.
Gus and Vaughn both got on the scoresheet in an all-England men's final between Mavericks and Storm,
with Mavericks winning a close contest 10-8. England Phoenix, featuring Invicta's Matthew Mayall,
narrowly missed out on the bronze medal, finishing fourth after losing 8-6 to Ireland in the play-off.
Vaughn topped the scoring charts for the tournament and was named as the coach's MVP (Most Valuable
Player).

England's women went one better than the men by completing a clean sweep of the medals. Lydia and
Millie were part of the England Storm team that beat France 4-3 in a tight bronze medal match.
