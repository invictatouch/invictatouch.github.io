Invicta finished as Division Two runners-up at the first round of the mixed National Touch
Series in Burton-on-Trent at the weekend, earning promotion to Division One in the process.

With five debutants the team exceeded expectations, winning two out of three pool games to earn a
place in the cup quarter-finals. A comfortable win over London Scorpions' third team was followed
by a narrow victory over Cheltenham Tigers in the semi-final, which set-up a final rematch against
London Vipers, whom we had defeated by a single score earlier in the day.

The Vipers got their revenge with a 5-2 win but both sides earned promotion to Division Two for
the next round back in Burton in two weeks' time, where they will compete among the top
16 mixed teams in the country.

*Team: Grace An, Holly Atkinson, Cassandra Firman, Toby Lister, Charlie Meredith, Stuart Meredith,
Vaughn Meredith, Ashleigh Newbold, Eliot Nye, Christian Scott, Amelia Shailes, Alex Waldron, James Waldron
