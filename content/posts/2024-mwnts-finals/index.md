For the first game of the day the stallions were handed the toughest possible quarter-final draw
against number one seeds London Scorpions. Playing three players short of a full 14-man squad,
Invicta lost 11-3 to the eventual champions.

After that early set-back, Invicta bounced back to defeat Manchester Foxes 8-5 to confirm Division
One status for next year before finishing the day with a narrow 8-7 victory over Cambridge to
finish the men's and women's season ranked as the 5th best men's team in the country. Attention now
turns to the elite mixed series, which begins in Burton-on-Trent on 8th June.

*Team: Ryan Attwood, Matthew Bate, James Firth, Gus Lister, JJ Lister, Toby Lister, Charlie Meredith,
Stuart Meredith, Vaughn Meredith, Christian Scott, Ryan Winter*
