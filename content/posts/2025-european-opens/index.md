Following hot on the heels of the Atlantic Youth Touch Cup in Ireland at the beginning of August
and the European Seniors Touch Cup in Scotland this week, the final international tournament of the
summer features the elite of European touch &mdash; the open divisions.

England Touch is showcasing its strength in depth by fielding multiple teams &mdash; Mavericks,
Phoenix, and Storm &mdash; in both the men's and the women's competitions, giving more players
the experience of international touch and a chance to stake a claim for a place in the full England
teams that will compete in the European Championships in France next year.

In the men's open division, Invicta's Vaughn Meredith and Gus Lister are in the England Mavericks
team while Matthew Mayall is playing for England Phoenix. Invicta women's players Lydia Ticehurst
and Millie Bunn are included in the England Storm women's open team.

The tournament taps off on Thursday 21st August at Rugby Calvisano and the finals are on Sunday 24th
August.
