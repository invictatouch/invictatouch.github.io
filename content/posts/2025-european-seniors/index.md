Six of Invicta Touch's most experienced players have been selected to play in the England masters

[European Senior Touch Cup](https://www.zeeon.co.uk/gamehubplus/european-seniors-cup) in Scotland
next week.

Suzanne Wilson will feature for England in the women's 40s/45s division in the three-day tournament
at the University of Stirling, with Dan Dyer in the men's 45s, Adrian Riggs in the men's 50s, and
Eddie French, Spencer Nye and Martin Reynard playing for the men's over-55s.

This tournament and the equivalent open divisions event in Italy later in the month are the first
competitions in a new four-year cycle for international touch following last year's World Cup. They
provide an opportunity for teams to build towards next summer's full European Championships in
France and eventually the 2028 World Cup in New Zealand.

Nine countries from across Europe will be competing in Stirling. The first games are on the morning
of Friday 15th August with the finals taking place on Sunday 17th August.
[Full fixtures](https://internationaltouch.org/events/other-events/european-seniors-cup-2025/) are
available on the Federation of International Touch website.
Games on field 1 will be live-streamed (without commentary) on the
[Scottish Touch YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@scottishtouchassociation).
