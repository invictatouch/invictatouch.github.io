Nine Invicta Touch players have been selected to represent the South East region at the Touch Nationals
in Nottingham over the May Day bank holiday weekend and a further four will feature for the South West.
<!--more-->
The Nationals features regional teams from around the country competing in open, senior, and masters
divisions (the junior Nationals will be played in September). Teams representing the South East
play as either the *Sharks* or the *Taipans* -- or both in the case of the open divisions.

The Invicta influence extends beyond our home region with four of our NTS players also having been
selected to represent the South West Saxons.
