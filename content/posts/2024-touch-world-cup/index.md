Invicta Touch stalwarts Adrian Riggs and Spencer Nye helped England's masters teams to win bronze
medals at the recent Touch World Cup in Nottingham.

This was the first time that the Touch World Cup, first staged in 1988 and now in its tenth edition,
had been hosted in England and there were teams from 35 countries involved across 13 men's, women's,
and mixed divisions.

Adrian was part of the England men's 50s team that narrowly overcame the USA 5-4 in the bronze medal
match while Spencer won bronze with the England men's 55s, defeating the USA in the
semi-finals but losing out to New Zealand in the preliminary final.

There was also Invicta involvement in the men's 45s division with Eddie French assistant coach for
an England side that lost in the quarter-finals to eventual winners Australia.

The next World Cup will take place in New Zealand in 2028.
