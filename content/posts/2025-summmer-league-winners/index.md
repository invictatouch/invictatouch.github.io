The Invicta Touch Canterbury Summer League was won by Wombles for the second year in a row with
victory over Dump Him Quick in the Cup final.

In the second-tier Plate final, Leg Catchers defeated Human Touch to claim the trophy. Trysexuals
were victorious over Burgess Hodgson in the Bowl final, and Boys Become Even Bigger Men won
against Touching Turkeys to claim the Shield.

Isaac Little (Misfits) was named overall male MVP (Most Valuable Player) and there was a tie for
female MVP between Lucy Relf (Burgess Hodgson) and Poppy Sands (Leg Catchers). Each of our MVPs
won a voucher for a one-night stay at [The Dog at Wingham](https://www.thedog.co.uk/).
Erin Collins was named Most Valuable Referee.

Thanks to all of our team sponsors and to [The Old City Bar](https://www.oldcitybar.co.uk) for their
support. The summer league will be back in May 2026. Team registration will open in the spring -
keep an eye on our website for details.
