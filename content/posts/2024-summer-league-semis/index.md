After seven weeks of hard-fought round-robin action the 2024 [Invicta Touch Summer League]({{<relref "/league/2024" >}})
has reached the semi-final stage. The top four in each division will contest the main prizes
while the other teams play-off to be best of the rest.
<!--more-->
Multiple former winners the Wombles topped Social League 1 ahead of the only team to have beaten
them so far this season, Not Trying Enough. Below the top two, three teams were level on 19 points
with Ruck Me Till I Scrum and last season's second tier winners, Human Touch, claiming the final two
Cup semi-final spots on try difference ahead of the Pythons who go into the Plate semi-finals with
the remaining teams.

In Social League 2 the wise old touch heads of The REDS lead the way, being the only team in either
division to remain unbeaten so far. Boys Become Men, Exiles, and Ashford Bumblebees complete the Cup
semi-final line-up with Touched 4 the Very 3rd Time just missing out on try difference.

All semi-finals will be played on Wednesday 3rd July at the Langton School for Boys in Canterbury,
tap-off times TBC.
