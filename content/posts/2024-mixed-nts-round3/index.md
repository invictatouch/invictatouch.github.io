  in Burton-on-Trent on Saturday.

This was a great end to a season that we began in Division Two, before winning promotion to to the
top division at Round 1 in June, and surpassed the 5th place achieved by our men's team earlier this
year.

Wins against London Galaxy and Cambridge Hornets in the pool stage set up a quarter-final against
NQ Rebels, which Invicta edged 4-3. Nottingham Hoods took the semi-final honours but we finished
on a high by defeating Nottingham Mavericks in the third-place play-off to secure the club's first
ever top 3 finish at an elite national event.

*Team: Holly Atkinson, Cassandra Firman, Gus Lister, Toby Lister, Matt Mayall, Charlie Meredith,

Lydia Ticehurst, Alex Waldron, James Waldron*
